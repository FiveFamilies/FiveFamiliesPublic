Five Families Project Framework v0.1 (ALPHA)
</div>
<hr/>

## Introduction

The Five Families is a Mafia-based play-to-earn Blockchain game, where five crime families fight for control of the city "Nova Costra."

Nova Costra is a crime-laden land where the police and politicians are so corrupted, that the Five Families essentially own the city themselves. The five families are constantly fighting for control of land and prime real estate in the centre of the city.

In the city there are bars, clubs, casinos and other small business which the mafia families look to extend control over and receive protection money for.

If the family controls a majority of the town, they will be the dominant power and receive benefits from the town and its inhabitants.

## Description

The ultimate goal is to create an original game engine using Unity, to build up our framework and to create accessible compatibility with the Cardano Blockchain.

## Development

We are currently using Unity version: **2021.2.2.**.

Development takes place in our **develop** branch and therefore is covering more features and possible fixes. This is currently not available to the public as it is still in HEAVY development.

## Progress so far

N/A

## Disclaimer

The project is currently undergoing **HEAVY** development and therefore is not currently available for public testing.
