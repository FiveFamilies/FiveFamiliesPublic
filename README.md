## Introduction

The Five Families is a Mafia-based play-to-earn Blockchain game, where five crime families fight for control of the city "Nova Costra."

Nova Costra is a crime-laden land where the police and politicians are so corrupted, that the Five Families essentially own the city themselves. The five families are constantly fighting for control of land and prime real estate in the centre of the city.

In the city there are bars, clubs, casinos and other small business which the mafia families look to extend control over and receive protection money for.

If the family controls a majority of the town, they will be the dominant power and receive benefits from the town and its inhabitants.

## Story Line & Concept

The Five Families fight for control of Nova Costra, a crime laden land with the police losing control of the streets. The Families are fighting for control of land and prime Real Estate in the centre of town. In town there are bars, clubs, casinos, and other small businesses which the mafia look to extend control over and receive protection money. If the family controls a majority of the town, they will be the dominant power and the family bosses will receive the “Pizzo” from the city dwellers.

The Five Families will be battling for control, the bosses will be leading the fight and recruiting family members in order to retain an advantage over the other families and win the war. Rewards will be available each week for fighting family members with the “Pizzo” to be distributed to the winning family at the end of the war. 

There will be One Hundred Bosses and 2500 citizens of Nova Costra, police officers, enforcers, arms dealers… who will join a family of their choosing, either for personal gain, greed or loyalty.

There will be only 20 of each family boss (100 total bosses), ownership of a boss grants you a leading role in the family and also founder status on your family’s chat. Being a boss grants you exclusive access to the “Pizzo” reward, payable by the citizens of Nova Costra to the controlling family. 

Being one of the characters in the city allows you to play your part in the war, there are 5 other characters (2500 in total) which will be critical to the war effort. Each ordinary character will be able to pick which family he would prefer to join based on his/her own personal interests. Being an active family member in a battle allows you to be eligible for rewards which are distributed from the racketeering business or bribes paid from the family bosses for your loyalty.
